#### launch files ####
The launch files contain a generic base directory {project_loc:releng}
That is to say that if you cannot evaluate this base directory make sure that you have the "releng" project in your workspace before executing them.
Any other problems are likely to be on our end so feel free to mention them in the [Papyrus mailing list][Ref1] or [forum][Ref2]
