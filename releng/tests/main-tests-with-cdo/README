In order to run the Papyrus Tests, with CDO installed, we need to define the target platform in the Eclipse launch config:
<listEntry value="target.platform=org.eclipse.papyrus.main.tests.cdo.portable.target"/>

On Hudson, we must configure the job with the same information.

We are not able to run the job with the expected target platform due to the current Papyrus pom architecture. 
Without this information, maven uses the 'normal' target platform defined for the Papyrus tests.
