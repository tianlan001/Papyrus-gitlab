This plugin is here, to check that the CDO version of metamodels used in Papyrus are in the tested installation.
So we run, in a dedicated job, the Papyrus JUnit tests, using the metamodels provided by CDO. (UML, Notation, and others).
So this plugin doesn't execute CDO JUnit tests, it just check the CDO installation.
So the tests result must be the same than without CDO installed of course.
