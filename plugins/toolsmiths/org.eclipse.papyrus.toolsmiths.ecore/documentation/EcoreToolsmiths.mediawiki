=Papyrus Ecore Toolsmiths=
This plugin has been developed to improve the developer experience for UML2Ecore user.
The Ecore models allows to add EAnnotation to EObject to define more precisely the expected generation. 
This plugin provides ModelExplorer customization to display the EAnnotation and their Details Entries (custom file EAnnotationCustom, not loaded by default).
This plugin provides the basic EMF property view to edit EAnnotation and Detail Entry elements.
The ModelExplorer View provides command to create EAnnotation and Detail Entry objects.
