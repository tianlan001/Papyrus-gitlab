Two validation problems are reported when developer validate the VSM papyrus_profile.odesign

They are both false validation problems and developers should not take them into account.

* First false validation problem : 
newContainer variable is unknown from the validation mechanism on drop tools.
The Sirius interpreter can use this variable without problem, it is just unknown from validation.
A Bugzilla ticket has been created to trace it : https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=580996

* Second false validation problem :
importMetaClass service is unknown from the validation mechanism on importMetaclass creation tool
If you import in your workspace org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core and org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.widgets plugins, validation will be OK.
Another solution is to validate your VSM in the runtime of your eclipse environment.
