- make the location of time elements relative to the center line of a compact timeline (instead of the top left corner)
  so that they stay put when the lifeline height changes
- reconnect a DurationObservation or DurationConstraint to the new StateInvariant when a StateInvariant is cut in two (inserting an occurrence)
- more unit tests (see /org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.timing.tests/TODO.txt)


dropped features:
- zooming on Lifelines
- message labels : will be handled generically on all links in Papyrus sometime in the future
