=Architecture View=
The Architecture view allows to visualize the architecture contexts registered in the running Eclipse instance.
You can open this view by the menu ''''Window''''>''''Show view''''>''''Other...'''' and select ''''Architecture View'''' in ''''Papyrus Dev'''' category:

In this view, the registered architecture contexts, both from the extension point and models in the workspace that are added in the Papyrus Architecture preferences, are presented in a tree showing:
# The architecture domains at the top level
# The architecture contexts in each domain
# The viewpoints in each context

The contents of the view are re-loaded whenever the Papyrus Architecture preferences are changed, but not when changes within a registered architecture model in the workspace are saved in the model editor.

The columns of this view are the following:
# The name
# The identifier of the architecture
# Whether the architecture domain is merged or not: a merged architecture domain is a domain with the same name as another domain
# The file name of the architecture model
# The plugin name containing the architecture model file
# Whether the architecture domain is valid (does not present model validation problems)

* The columns can be sorted by clicking on their headers
* An architecture domain can be opened in the editor by double-clicking on it
