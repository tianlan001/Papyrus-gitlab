If the view is already open, it is updated with the references found without taking the focus.

==== Toggle button 'Link with Editor' ====

The other way to display all references of an item, is to use the button "Link with Editor" in the 'References' view. 
This action displays the references of the active selection. Itâ€™s only available on the diagram selection.
