== Browse meta-model from EMF Registry ==

You can browse a registered meta-model from the EMF Registry using either '''Navigate > Open EPackage''' or the corresponding action [[Image:../img/logoMoDiscoMini.gif]] in the main toolbar. The following dialog will pop up, allowing you to select a meta-model by URI :

Either double-click or press OK on the desired meta-model. It will be opened in the EMF Facet Default EPackage Browser, or in the one you would have previously indicated in the preference page.

== Default Browser ==
You can choose which model browser you prefer to use, by going to '''Window > Preferences''', in section '''EMF Facet > Default Browser''':

And selecting which model browser you'd like to use when:
* opening a '''Resource'''
* opening an '''EObject'''
* opening an '''EPackage'''

== EPackage Registry View ==
You can easily display the contents of the EMF Registry in a view, by opening the EMF Facet EPackage Registry view:

From this view, you can double click on any EPackage to browse it in your default browser.
