An Aggregate <b>aggregates</b> FacetSets and Customizations. 
This should not be confused with a hierarchical FacetSet, which is a <b>composition</b> instead of an aggregation.
Also note that Customizations and Aggregates are both FacetSets (they extend the FacetSet metaclass).</p><p>Aggregates are defined in plug-in <b>org.eclipse.papyrus.emf.facet.aggregate.metamodel</b>. An aggregate is defined in a file with the ".efacet" file extension, because the aggregate metamodel extends the facet metamodel, and this allows transparent registration of aggregates in the FacetSet and Customization catalogs.</p><p>Loading an Aggregate means loading all its aggregated FacetSets and Customizations. And unloading an Aggregate means unloading all its aggregated FacetSets and Customizations.</p><p>To create a new aggregate:</p><ul><li>add <b>org.eclipse.papyrus.emf.facet.aggregate.metamodel</b> to your plug-in dependencies</li><li>create a new Aggregate in a file with the ".efacet" file extension</li><li>add references in the Aggregate to FacetSets and Customizations that must be aggregated, using the <b>aggregatedFacetSets</b> reference defined on the Aggregate metaclass</li><li>register the aggregate using the extension point <b>org.eclipse.papyrus.emf.facet.util.emf.core.modeldeclaration</b></li></ul><p>Here is an example of an Aggregate (named <i>libraryAggregate</i>) for a library metamodel, which aggregates a FacetSet (named <i>libraryFacetSet</i>) and a Customization (named <i>libraryCustomization</i>) :</p><p><img border="0" src="../img/aggregateExample.png"/></p><h3 id="XMI_example">XMI example</h3><p>Since there is no UI tooling for creating Aggregates as yet, you will have to use a generic model editor or write the XMI by hand. Here is an example XMI file that defines an Aggregate:</p><pre>
