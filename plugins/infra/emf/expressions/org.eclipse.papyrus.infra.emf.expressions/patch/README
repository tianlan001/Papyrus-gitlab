This patch must be applied on UMLUtil file in the plugin org.eclipse.uml2.uml.

It allows us to manage the template from UML model to Ecore Model

//TODO : something has been done for Property Type, the same thing must probably be done for OperationParameter ? 
//TODO : manage the order of the template parameter subsitution (currently it works only when the order is the same between the declare and the template binding in UML model
