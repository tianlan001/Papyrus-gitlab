# Contributing to Eclipse Papyrus

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse Papyrus provides an integrated, user-consumable environment for editing
any kind of EMF model and particularly supporting UML and related modeling
languages such as SysML and MARTE. Papyrus provides diagram editors for
EMF-based modeling languages amongst them UML 2 and SysML and the glue required
for integrating these editors (GMF-based or not) with other MBD and MDSD tools.
It also offers a very advanced support of UML profiles that enables users to
define editors for DSLs based on the UML 2 standard and its extension
mechanisms. The main feature of Papyrus regarding this latter point is a set of
very powerful customization mechanisms which can be leveraged to create
user-defined Papyrus perspectives and give it the same look and feel as a native
DSL editor.
